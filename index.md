# Project 1 Pwnagotchi 
My first project that I wanted to tackle was the pwnagotchi. A pwnagotchi is a small penertration testing tool used for   Wi-Fi packet sniffing and handshake capture. The way it captures these handshakes is when a client or phone attempts to connect or reconnect to a router for internet. When they do connect they perform an action called a 4-way handshake with the access point. If the Pwnagotchi is listening at the right time and on the right channel, it can capture that handshake for later cracking.
The pwnagotchi had another method of capturing handshakes if it cannot identify any client attempting to reconnect to an access point. The Pwnagotchi will send out deauth packets to force a client to reconnect, thus creating an opportunity to catch a handshake. 
## Storage and processing
captred handshakes are saved as a ".pcap" format or ".pcapng" under the directory "/root/handshakes"
## Offline Cracking
There are many tools on the internet used for cracking hash files. the most popular include hashcat, Aircrack-ng and John the ripper. Furthermore the most recognised wordlist used to crack these hashes is rockyou.txt

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
